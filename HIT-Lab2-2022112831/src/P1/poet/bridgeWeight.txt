If equal affection cannot be, let the more loving be me
Whatever your past has been, you have a spotless future
Embrace the glorious mess that you are
You can't expect him to be perfect nobody is
Life is a load of running, it is necessary to constantly in each choose a fork in the road
Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move
I love you not for who you are, but for who I am with you
Don't fear you forsake, just afraid of losing you
It is a new world
It is a new day
You never know how handsome that you are
So handsome the boys that they are
